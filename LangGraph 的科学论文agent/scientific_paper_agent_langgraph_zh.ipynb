Using a standardized query - \"Find 8 papers on quantum machine learning\" - we evaluated performance across key metrics including response time, metadata quality, and academic value. Our analysis reveals distinct trade-offs: while our agent takes longer to process (30s vs. 2-5s), it provides significantly more detailed metadata, validated sources, and structured academic output. The comparison table above breaks down these differences across multiple dimensions, helping users choose the right tool for their specific research needs - whether it's quick exploration (where Copilot excels) or deep academic research (where our agent shows its strengths).\n\n在这里，我们对我们的研究助手代理与领先平台（Microsoft Copilot 和 Perplexity AI）进行了全面比较。使用标准化查询 - “查找 8 篇关于量子机器学习的论文” - 我们评估了在响应时间、元数据质量和学术价值等关键指标上的表现。我们的分析揭示了明显的权衡：虽然我们的代理处理时间较长（30秒对比2-5秒），但它提供了更加详细的元数据、经过验证的来源和结构化的学术输出。上面的比较表在多个维度上详细分解了这些差异，帮助用户选择适合他们特定研究需求的工具 - 无论是快速探索（Copilot 在这方面表现出色）还是深入的学术研究（我们的代理在这方面展现其优势）。\n\n"
